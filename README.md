# Argentum Resto

> This project is a single-page website that was built as part of Microverse's JavaScript module.

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

The main goal of this project is to show the understanding of the benefits of modularized code as well as the ability to set up a javascript application made of different modules using webpack.

All the content on the website has been added via JavaScript, and a tab system has been implemented using event listeners to allow the user to switch between "Home", "Contact" and "Menu" views.
